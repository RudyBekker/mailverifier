# Bulk Free Email Verifier
We were looking for a cost effective way to bulk verify some of our emails in our database, looked everywhere online for a solid solution and the prices were just absolutely insane! 

We looked at multiple open source solutions and nothing was straight forward and easy to use. 

So we went to the drawing board and found a few cool open source projects and modified them for a simple administration of bulk verifying emails ðŸŽ‰

If you encounter any bugs or issues, or have any suggestions, please let us know or feel free to create a PR and we will merge it.
